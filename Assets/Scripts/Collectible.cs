 * HOW IT WORKS:
 * Note: Requires the GameManager.cs script to be attached to something in the scene.
 * 
 * This script makes it so that when something enters its hitbox, do
 * 	1) Check if it is the player that entered. If not, return.
 *  2) Tell the GameManager that an item has been collected.
 *  3) Delete itself
